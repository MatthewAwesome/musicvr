## Project Overview

### What is synesthesia?

Synesthesia is a sensory blending so to speak. Those who experience it may, for example, see sound manifest as color! 

### How does this relate to the presnt experiment: 

Synesthesia is a powerful concept! Thus, it made me think: what if such notion could be used to fundamentally augment music education? 

Rather than learning to read music looking at black notes on a white background, what if we allowed notes (and chords) to assume a well-defined color?

Such is the essence of this experiment! By mapping notes to color, musical minds can correlate sound to color. In doing so, perhaps users can, with the aid of immersion through VR, form synesthetic connections that forever change the way they 'picture' music!
